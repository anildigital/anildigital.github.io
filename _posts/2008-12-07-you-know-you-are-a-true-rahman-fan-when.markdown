1. You have a peculiar taste in music, which does not
necessarily have to match the taste of the "masses".

2. You have a good sense of melody and rhythm and can tell good
music from average. You appreciate good music, regardless of who it
comes from.

3. You can go on for hours talking about Rahman when someone
makes a mistake of asking you about your favorite music.

4. You are never content and are always hungry and thirsty for
more from Rahman.

5. You have had many euphoric moments in your life.. connected
with Rahman's music.

6. You agree that an average Rahman song is better than the best
most of the other can churn out.

7. Regardless of how the World finds Rahman music, you think
Rahman makes music just for your ears. You genuinely believe that
Rahman somehow knows what kind of music you unconsciously crave and
then magically delivers that to you.

8. Your most prized collection in your entire music collection
is your Rahman collection, whether it's in form of cassettes, CD's or
hard-disk space on computer or ipods.

9. You sometimes feel this bliss, a kind of feeling that you are
in heaven, when listening to Rahman's music.

10. If the World was to go back to using the barter system again,
you wouldn't mind trading a 1000 non-Rahman songs for a single Rahman
song.

11. You share this special bond with Rahman which is impossible
to describe in words, let alone explain it to others.

12. Your friends/family fail to understand why you listen to
music in a language that makes no sense to you, whatsoever. But, a
few weeks later, you totally understand why your friends/family are
humming/singing the very song they don't understand and were puzzled
about you listening to it.

13. You are part of the Rahman Yahoo! Group or Orkut A R Rahman fans
Community and visit it at least
once a day.

14. You take pleasure in new group (community) members arguing with
likes of
Gops and Vijay, when they come out with some Rahman info/news.

15. You are tired of new member joining the group and inquiring
about and referring to the fake "Ekyam Satyam". You too hope to
listen to the real one someday, if it exists somewhere.

16. You can talk to any other Rahman fan and connect with them
instantly.

17. You have a deep desire to meet Rahman in person, and know
deep in your heart that one day your dream will come true.

18. You have thought of it many a times and tried to come up with
a plan of what you would do? How would you react? when you actually
meet Rahman.

19. You can find the challenging task of solving a complex
problem rather easy compared to the daunting and difficult task of
coming up with your absolute top-10 Rahman favorites.

20. Any criticism of Rahman is hard for you to digest, because
most of the time it comes from people that haven't heard enough of
Rahman and yet have no problem talking about him.

21. Your blood pressure tends to rise when an average listener
sings praises for other MDs(especially Anu Malik, Harris J, and the
more recent and annoying Himesh).

22. When it comes to R.D. Burman or may be Illayaraja, you tend
to put an end to the conversation by saying... "No doubt, Illayaraja
is the greatest, but I think Rahman is even better"... because it's
true. (Self-fulfilling prophecy?)

23. You are a select few in the country that are familiar with
obscure terms such as "BGM" or "Interlude" etc. And furthermore, you
are a rare breed of fans that actually collects and listens to
these "BGM" and "Musical bits" used in commercials.

24. You can listen to an hour of non-stop Rahman interludes and
guess over 80% of them right.

25. You eagerly wait for each and every Rahman release, you set
very high expectations for each album, a day after the release you
will bash the album as below-average, a few months later you will
hail the same album as a masterpiece and one of your personal
favorites.

26. You suffer from this rare condition where... you wake up from
your sleep, humming or singing a Rahman tune, involuntarily. You
realize the condition is severe when you randomly shout out a Rahman
tune you haven't heard in a long time.

27. You may forget to take your dose of medication but you can
not forget to get your daily dose of Rahman.

28. You set high expectations of Rahman, and are honored and
touched that he cares about you and works hard to satisfy you.

29. You know and realize that Rahman is potentially the most
creative composer to ever live in India, and may be even the World.

30. You love and respect Rahman, the human being and not just
Rahman, the composer.
