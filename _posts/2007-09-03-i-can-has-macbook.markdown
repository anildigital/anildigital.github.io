Recently I bought a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook">MacBook</a>. Earlier, I had planned to buy MacBook Pro but I finally went for MacBook. I am very happy with my decision. I am kinda addicted with my MacBook now.

Few days ago, my friend Akshay bought similar MacBook. He has written some blog posts informing in detail about MacBook.  So instead of here I describing my MacBook here.. am giving you list of links of Akshay's blog posts.

It is because of Premshree, I came to know about Apple machines, and how they are cool and the best. Thanks man!

I have been using Windows for very long time (since I was in 7th standard).  So really needed something different. I have been using Linux and flavors for almost 5 years. I always felt Windoze sucks compared to Linux/Unix. I would say Windoze in pain. :)

I have installed following <strong>must have</strong> software on my MacBook ...
<a href="http://www.adiumx.com">Adium</a> - For instant messaging.
<a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> = For fast application launching and productivity
<a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> - Proved best text editor and best for ROR development on Mac.
<a href="http://macvim.org/OSX/index.php">VIM</a> - My all time favorite text editor (ardent lover)
<a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/">iTerm</a> - Nice alternative for existing Mac shell (I like tabs feature)
<a href="http://http://sourceforge.net/projects/vienna-rss">Vienna</a> - Great RSS reader
<a href="http://colloquy.info">Colloquy</a> - IRC client.

Installed <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>, <a href="http://finkproject.org/">Fink</a>, these allow install most of Unix based software(ports) on Mac. Yet, I have not installed <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/">Xcode</a> tools as it has to be downloaded(900 Mb+) and installed, or install using disc. Though Ruby comes pre-installed on Mac, it's not 1.8.6 My installation of Ruby, Rails and similar is pending due absence of Xcode tools. I am going to install those using MacPorts and MacPorts requires Xcode tools to be present. I will install those in couple of days

I have some cool plans for new adventures on my Mac. I hope those will come out very soon.
