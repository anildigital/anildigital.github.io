Today I met with Abhijeet Sawant &amp; Rahul Vaidya. Everybody knows Indian Idol Abhijeet and semi finalist Rahul Vaidya. There was an ad in today’s The Times of India that they are coming at ‘Planet M music store at Camp, Pune.<br /><img alt="" src="http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/2346/planetm28qy.png" border="0" /><br />As today is a holiday and Planet M is near to my house so I and my brother Santosh went there to see these guys at 3pm. Both Abhijeet and Rahul came at 4pm. For that between hour, RJ Mihir from Mumbai enjoyed we people present there. That one hour was so memorable. Abhijeet and Rahul at start sung Ganapati aarti. After that they sung songs from album ‘Hey Ganapati’. People requested Abhijeet to sing a song from his album ‘Aapka Abhijeet’. He sung ‘Lafzo mein….’ . At last they gave autographs on cds and cassettes of ‘Hey Ganpati’. The moment was very memorable.
