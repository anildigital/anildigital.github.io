Yes, latest version, iTunes 4.9 now supports podcasts in a wonderful way. Good news!. It was promised from apple that the new version will  have support for podcasts. For those who don’t know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting" target="_blank">podcasting</a> is like a radio show that you regularly subscribe to, the podcasting software that you use downloads the mp3s of the show for you so that you can listen to it whenever/wherever you like. The difference is that anybody can start a radio show and anybody can subscribe. That’s right, just like blogs. <p>I have downloaded latest version and enjoying the new radio which is podcasting.  I wish <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/">NDTV</a> or <a href="http://www.aajtak.com/">Aaj Tak</a> had regular podcasts that I could listen to on a daily basis. Now, <em>that</em> would be cutting-edge…</p><p>To download the new iTunes 4.9 visit <a href="http://www.apple.com/iTunes/download/">http://www.apple.com/iTunes/download/</a></p>
