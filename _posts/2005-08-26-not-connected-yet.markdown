<img alt="" src="http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/3907/googletalk8lw.gif" border="0" /><br />I am still not able to connect into the Google Talk. Whenever I try to log into the Google talk with my Gmail id, I get the connection error.<br /><img alt="" src="http://img160.imageshack.us/img160/3650/error2ai.png" border="0" /><br />I read somewhere that I am getting this error due to Google Talkserver cannot handle the tsunami type connection request? But I think this should not be the reason behind it. Because, I am able to login to Google Talk through <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/downloads.php">GAIM</a>, Gaim is a multi-protocol instant messaging (IM) client for Linux, BSD, MacOS X, and Windows and it is free.<br /><img alt="" src="http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/2371/gaim6aw.png" border="0" /><br />Then, what should be the problem for Google Talk? I am using Airtel GPRS for accessing the internet, speed is quite fine. Please comment if you know anything related to this issue.
