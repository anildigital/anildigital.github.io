My company <a href="http://mangospring.com">MangoSpring</a> has a very nice <a href="http://mangospring.com/blogs/" title="MangoSpring Blog">blog</a>. Nice bunch of good posts are there.
We internally in company also have a intranet blog where everybody shares posts and good articles and nice technical stuff too.
I too have written a post titled "<strong><em>How can we send consolidated emails in RoR at regular intervals of time?</em></strong>" on MangoSpring <a href="http://mangospring.com/blogs/">blog</a>, but you have to find that out.
