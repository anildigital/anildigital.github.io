<p align="justify"><a href="http://del.icio.us/"><img alt="" src="http://img472.imageshack.us/img472/5267/delicious42px9gj.gif" align="left" border="0" />del.icio.us</a> have started <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2006/03/private_saving_.html">private bookmarking feature</a>. It is still in beta. I am a regular user of del.icio.us, I think the power of del.icio.us is in social bookmarking, means all your bookmarks are public. Anyone can see anybody others bookmarks. So with the help of this we get collective effort of people and discover many new links which are really too useful. But now allowing users to privately bookmark the sites, it is not possible. Now person will not share an illegal link or any sensitive link. Discovery of such links is in danger. But from users’ point of view, private bookmarking is attractive. There were many users who were not using del.icio.us for lack of private bookmarking feature. I also had some bookmarks which I did not want to share with anybody. Now, I have made them private. It is a very big step from del.icio.us.</p>
