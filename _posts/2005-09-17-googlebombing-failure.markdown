Recently, I got an email with following content<br /><blockquote>This one is too good !!!<br /><br />This is why people say google is the best search engine.<br /><br />Its not only fast, its accurate and shows only truth.<br /><br />--&gt; Open Google Site [ <a href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com</a> ]<br />--&gt; Type 'failure' or 'miserable failure'<br />--&gt; See what is the Very First Match !<br /><br />Hope you had a heartily laugh at this one.</blockquote>Yesterday, <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/">Google blog</a> have responded to this by a <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/googlebombing-failure.html">post</a> on the blog.
