It is raining outside. What a cool days these are?  I am excited. I like the mansoon season. This rain reminds me many past moments. I like these days. I like to get wet in rain. I like to go Lonavala, Sinhgad to enjoy the beautiful nature. Last year I had gone to Lonavala and enjoyed the cool Bhushi Dam. I swam in it. I think these days are the best days. We should enjoy these moments to our fulliest.
