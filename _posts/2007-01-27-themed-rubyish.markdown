<p>Woot!<br />I successfully tried to imitate the <a href="http://premshree.livejournal.com/">Premshree's Personal Weblog's</a> theme. This was my third try in the&nbsp;year. Two times I could not successfully imitate&nbsp;the theme. Today, I&nbsp;thought to again imitate it. Just with some luck, I made it. Now my blog looks somewhat similar to Premshree's. I am not very good at CSS. but I understand it and can hack at any level.<br />I liked the Rubyishness of <a href="http://premshree.livejournal.com/">Premshree's blog</a>. I always wanted to have similar looking blog (As I am inspired by his blogging, and blogging style). I already started liking brownish red color of Ruby. Many Ruby websites and blogs use it excessively. I could not resist myself&nbsp;using it.<br />Reading and writing to such Rubyish blog is very inspiring to me than the typical style regular colored/themed&nbsp;blogs.</p>
