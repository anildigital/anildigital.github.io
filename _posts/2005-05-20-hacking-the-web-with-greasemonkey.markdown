<p>Yesterday, while surfing, I came to know that there is a popular Firefox extension named <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/" target="_blank">Greasemonkey</a>. As I have a lot of extensions already installed on my firefox browser, I was little bit hesitating it to install. But finally I installed it. I didn’t know how to use that extension. So I read <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/using.html" target="_blank">how to use Greasemonkey</a>. I then visited this <a href="http://dunck.us/collab/GreaseMonkeyUserScripts" target="_blank">site</a> for useful user scripts. Using Greasemonkey, I installed a excellent user script <a href="http://dunck.us/code/greasemonkey/Gmail_Smart-Delete_Button.user.js">Gmail Smart-Delete Button</a>. I went Gmail site, logged into the Gmail. I was amazed to see a direct delete button for all mails added on my Gmail’s interface. I liked it very much that, I immediately installed another script which removes ads from <a href="http://www.indiatimes.com/" target="_blank">Indiatimes.com</a> which is <a href="http://www.thejo.in/code/greasemonkey/adskipper_indiatimes.user.js" target="_blank">Indiatimes.com Ads skipper</a>. I visited to Indiatimes.com site, I am shocked to see that there were no ads on Indiatimes.com. <span style="font-size:180%;">Excellent!!!!!</span> </p><p>Greasemonkey is a revolutionary Firefox extension that many feel has enormous implications for the future evolution of the web. In recent Greasemonkey news, Mark Pilgrim just published a comprehensive primer called '<a href="http://diveintogreasemonkey.org/" target="_blank">Dive Into Greasemonkey</a>', a must-read for those who want to try their hand at writing their own scripts. It should be noted that Greasemonkey is not without controversy, but this has done nothing to reduce its popularity among web programmers.</p><p><i>Technorati Tags</i>: <a title="Technorati tag greasemonkey" href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/greasemonkey" target="_blank" rel="tag">Greasemonkey</a>, <a title="Technorati tag firefox" href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/firefox" target="_blank" rel="tag">Firefox</a>, <a title="Technorati tag extension" href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/extension" target="_blank" rel="tag">Extension</a>, <a title="Technorati tag blog" href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/blog" target="_blank" rel="tag">Blog</a> </p>
