It is now official that <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/4/2/rails-is-moving-from-svn-to-git">Rails is moving to Git</a>. I am more happy because I love both <a href="http://git.or.cz">Git</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>. From last couple of months Git became my favourite source control tool. I was so much excited about it that I read most articles/posts/manuals about it for last some months, I gave a BarCamp <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/anildigital/git-introduction?src=embed">presentation</a> on it. I have been using it lot, for my personal side-projects.

Some days ago, I forked <a href="https://github.com/NZKoz/koz-rails/tree">koz-rails</a>(Rails repo git mirror) repository, considering that I would start hacking Rails source. I had no idea that Rails would officially move to Git that time. I had read some posts of Koz that it is not that easy to start using Git to manage Rails source. But now after reading <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/4/2/rails-is-moving-from-svn-to-githttp://">DHHs announcement post</a>, I am happy.

The good thing is that it will use <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> (awesome Git repository hosting site). I am in love with GitHub since I heard about it. I think, I am one of the earlier users of GitHub and that makes it and me special that Rails is using GitHub.

Even DHH himself has written <a href="http://loudthinking.com/posts/24-gits-avalanche">good words</a> about Git and GitHub. Chris also wrote <a href="http://github.com/blog/32-rails-moving-to-git">some</a> <a href="http://ozmm.org/posts/github_is_gits_killer_app.html">posts</a> related to this announcement.

I always find that like minded people like similar things and it continues. I also noticed that whatever I like becomes Hit and popular(oh yeah). I think I have some little sense to predict about any app and its future. I think I can definitely define product features for a successful app. I think I also understand the market and what people want and expect. This is why I am more eager to develop my side projects.
