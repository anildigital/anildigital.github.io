<p></p> <p>A list of rules, listed by Des by his experience in programming.  </p><ul> <li><b>The Ubiquity of Perl</b>  <blockquote>The likelihood of Perl being involved in a system is directly proportional to the length of time the system has been in maintenance.</blockquote> </li><li><b>Boasting</b>  <blockquote> <p>If you boast about how quickly you developed your product, people will complain about its performance. (Rails)  </p><p>If you boast about how well your product runs, people will complain about its development time. (Vista)  </p><p>If you don't boast about either, people will assume you are developing in Java. </p></blockquote> </li><li><b>Fitts Law</b>  <blockquote>If you can't click it easily after 3 cans of beer, then it's too small. (iTunes)<img alt="" src="http://www.minds.nuim.ie/%7Edez/images/blog/fitts.png" /></blockquote> </li><li><b>Fileformats</b>  <blockquote>Think twice before presuming that CSV is a nice little easy file format. (see <a href="http://secretgeek.net/csv_trouble.asp">Leon</a>)</blockquote> </li><li><b>Web 2.0: </b> <blockquote>For every 1.6 billion dollar buy out, there are 1.6 million start-ups in garages digging their own websites.</blockquote> </li><li><b>Startups 1</b>  <blockquote>If your target market is the readers of digg, reddit, and delicious then you're trying to sell shelves to a carpenter. If he <i>really</i> wanted them, he would have built them himself, years ago. </blockquote> </li><li><b>Startups 2</b>  <blockquote>If you build it, they might come. If you have a nice website they might stay. If you offer a free service, they might use it. If you've gotten this far without thinking about where the cash comes from , you're in trouble. </blockquote> </li><li><b>Software Development:</b>  <blockquote>For every Architecture Astronaut out there, there is at least one coder who thinks that being "Agile" is a perfect substitute for foresight. </blockquote> </li><li><b>Learning programming languages</b>  <blockquote>Every 5 minutes you spend writing code in a new language is more useful than 5 hours reading blog posts about how great the language is.</blockquote></li></ul>Original post by Dev Traynor <a href="http://www.minds.nuim.ie/%7Edez/serendipity/index.php?/archives/102-Programming-Theorems.html" target="_blank">Link</a>
