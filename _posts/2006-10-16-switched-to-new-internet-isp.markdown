<p><img src="http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/8800/gttpljl4.gif">&nbsp;<br />Today,&nbsp;I switched to <a href="http://gttpl.com">Golden Tiger Telecom Pvt. Ltd</a>&nbsp;for my internet connection. Before that I was using <a href="http://airtelworld.com">Airtel GPRS</a> for accessing the internet.&nbsp;I can't imagine the world without internet now. It's a necessary thing!<br />My plan is 64Kbps unlimited download&nbsp;for 30 days. I found this plan economical and worth of&nbsp;my needs!<br />I am thinking of launching some useful webpages using googlepages offcourse for adsense and public(software) interest! I have various ideas in my mind! My Airtel&nbsp;GPRS was so slow that I was unable to open pages.google.com for editing! Now it's got better, I&nbsp;am able&nbsp;edit it!<br /><br /><strong>update:&nbsp;</strong>I just found a nice webpage listing <a href="http://www.keepersoflists.org/index.php?lid=6094">Top 50 Things To Do When Your ISP Is Down</a>. Nice read!</p>
