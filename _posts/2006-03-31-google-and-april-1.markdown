<p>Exactly before two years on April 1, <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> launched 1GB mail, <a href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a>. Last year, on the same day Google started giving infinite mail space for Gmail! Tomorrow is the same day, What Google is going to do tomorrow! I am waiting for tomorrow! There must be something special from Google! I am a Google fan! I like Gmail the most! Gmail have changed my life! Tomorrow when I will wake up! I will turn on my PC and see for special gift!!!!<br /><br /><strong>UPDATE(April 2):</strong> As I have written about Google and April 1, Google have launched <a href="http://www.google.com/romance/">Google Romance</a>! ;)</p>
