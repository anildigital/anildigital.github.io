<p>Do check out <a href="http://planetrubyonrails.com/">http://planetrubyonrails.com</a>. My friend <a href="http://null.in/">Pratik</a> has developed a very nice rails application which aggregates xml feeds of <a href="http://www.planetrubyonrails.com/pages/channels">various rails blogs and websites</a>. You can try specific keyword search like <a href="http://rjs.planetrubyonrails.com/">http://rjs.planetrubyonrails.com</a> as dynamic subdomains searching is enabled. Black background posts are the ones which we should never miss.<br /><br />Pratik has started his own company <a href="http://thinkwares.com/">thinkwares</a> few months back. He and his team are developing some of the very cool in house web applications and they also work on client projects.<br /><br />To me, Pratik is a very inspiring guy. He is very much devoted to his work. I like his passion for <a href="http://rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a>.<br />Pratik is the guy who gave me first free Ruby on Rails hosting with his <a href="http://freeonrails.com/">FreeonRails.com</a>, also he gave me free domain name too. He has also provided me free space on his server <a href="http://rails.in/">Rails.in</a>.<br /><br />It helped me a lot in trying out various rails miniprojects live as a website. I got hands on experience of deploying the rails applications on servers, maintaining them and try some of the unusual things.</p>
