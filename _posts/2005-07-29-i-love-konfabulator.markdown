I have downloaded a lot of widgets now. I am finding these widgets very useful. At first, I thought widgets are similar to flash, but they are too cool than flash. I liked Yahoo’s decision making Konfabulator free. Yahoo! is making excellent use of widgets, making there services available using widgets. A simple example is Yahoo! search widget. Acquiring Flickr, Konfabulator, Yahoo! is in right way.
