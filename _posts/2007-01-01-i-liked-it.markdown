<p>Nice quote<br /> <blockquote>Ruby’s the only language I’ve ever used that feels like it was designed by a programmer, and not by a hardware engineer (Java, C, C++), an academic theorist (Lisp, Haskell, OCaml), or an editor of PC World (Python).<br /><a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/wmorgan/">William Morgan</a></blockquote>
