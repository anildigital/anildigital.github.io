<div style="text-align: justify;">Yesterday my second last submission in engineering completed. I was very happy. I played cricket after that. Enjoyed every moment of cricket. Now our PLs(preparation leaves) have started. PL-The most common and important part in engineering life. My friend Abhinav has <a href="http://theflamboyant.blogspot.com/2005/10/pls-engineers-nightmare-or-is-it.html">written something nice</a> about the PLs.</div>
