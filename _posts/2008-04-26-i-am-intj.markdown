	<b>General Description:</b>
INTJs understand complex relationships and use these insights to organize their life. If they are determined to see their inner vision realized, they can be businesslike and sometimes impersonal. Being visionaries, INTJs enjoy the complexities of new challenges and become bored quickly with unchanging routine. Of all the types, they are the most independent and may appear difficult to get to know until they have established a deeper relationship. 	

	<b>Career Insights:</b>
INTJs like to bring their inner visions into reality and can be determined in their pursuit of this goal. They understand the "big picture" quickly and are good at impersonal analysis. They enjoy intellectual people and organizations, where their quick conceptual grasp of things is appreciated. Careers that prove popular to INTJs include architecture, legal professions, engineering, science, human resource management and computer systems. 	</td></tr></tbody></table>
