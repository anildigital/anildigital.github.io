<img alt="" src="http://static.audioscrobbler.com/logo.gif" /> <p>If you listen to a lot of music in Winamp or iTunes, you might have come across <a href="http://audioscrobbler.com/" target="_blank">AudioScrobbler</a> - a site that tracks and displays what you've been listening to, in a free cool community kind of way. For example, you can <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com/user/anildigital/" target="_blank">see what I've been listening to lately</a>.</p><p>AudioScrobbler works via a free plugin, <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com/download.php?downloadid=8" target="_blank">plugin</a> for Winamp, <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com/download.php?downloadid=9" target="_blank">plugin</a> for Windows Media Player 9/10, <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com/download.php?downloadid=14" target="_blank">plugin</a> for iTunes(Windows) also for various media players including XMMS. Plugins send the name of every song you play to the Audioscrobbler server, which updates your musical profile with the new song. Every person with a plugin has their own page on this site which shows their listening statistics. The system automatically matches you to people with a similar music taste, and generatepersonalizeded recommendations.</p><p>I liked this service and downloaded AudioScrobbler plugins for my every media player. Now whatever song I play is tracked by AudioScrobbler. I mostly listen to <a href="http://http//www.imdb.com/name/nm0006246/">A.R. Rahman</a> tracks. Hence my AudioScrobbler tracks, A.R. Rahman as the top artist.</p><p>Technorati Tags: <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/AudioScrobbler" rel="tag">AudioScrobbler</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/tag" rel="tag">tag</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/social" rel="tag">social</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/audio" rel="tag">audio</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/music" rel="tag">music</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/tracks" rel="tag">tracks</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/itunes" rel="tag">iTunes</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/winamp" rel="tag">winamp</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/media" rel="tag">media</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/player" rel="tag">player</a>, <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/plugin" rel="tag">plugin</a></p>
