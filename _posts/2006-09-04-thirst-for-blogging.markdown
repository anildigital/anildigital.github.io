<p align="justify">I announced earlier that I will blog actively at <a href="http://anilw.info/blog/">http://anilw.info/blog/</a> which was setup using typo! I liked typo too much. But it was relatively too slow. My friend <a href="http://freeonrails.com/">Pratik</a> suggested me to start using <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">mephisto</a>. Mephisto is a blogging/content management software created by Rick Olson(<strong><u>technoweenie</u></strong>) of the Ruby On Rails Core team and Justin Palmer. I am in love with Rick&rsquo;s apps. I like <a href="http://beast.caboo.se/">Beast</a>. I like Rails <a href="http://pastie.caboo.se/">Pastie</a>. I like <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">mephisto</a>. I had some conversation with Rick via #mephisto channel on IRC. He is very helpful and guided me to setup my mephisto on my server. I got this server from Pratik. I refered <a href="http://mephisto.stikipad.com/help/show/Installing+Mephisto+on+a+shared+host">Pratik&rsquo;s tip</a> to install mephisto on shared hosting environment. But in vain, it required a different trick to setup mephisto on my server. I hope I will setup mephisto on server in couple of days. I will announce it on blog. ;) </p>
