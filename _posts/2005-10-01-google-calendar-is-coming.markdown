<p><a href="http://calendar.google.com/">http://calendar.google.com</a>, if you click at this link you go to Google homepage. It means Google is close to launch its new service Calendar. It will be more useful if it integrates its Calendar service with Gmail. I love Google products. Eagerly waiting for Calendar.</p>
