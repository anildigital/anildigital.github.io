<p>I&nbsp;just came to my home after attending the&nbsp;fantastic <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampPune2">BarCamp Pune 2</a>. It was a very nice event again. All the talks were awesome. I liked the talk of <a href="http://www.jonathanboutelle.com/">Jon</a> the most.&nbsp;His topic was "Architectures for scalable web applications in Ruby/Rails". Second talk I liked was of <a href="http://www.brajeshwar.com/">Brajeshwar</a> and <a href="http://www.abdulqabiz.com/blog/">Abdul</a> from <a href="http://nanocast.com">Nanocast</a>. They demonstarted features of <a href="http://www.nanocast.com/">Nanocast</a>, the next big thing! One talk which I wanted to attend but I missed is 'Firewatir' by <a href="http://angrez.blogspot.com">Angrez Singh</a>. Checkout <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampPune2">BarCampPune2 wiki</a> for more info!</p>
