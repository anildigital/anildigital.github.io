<p>Want to see music videos for all of your favorite tracks?&nbsp;I just&nbsp;checked out&nbsp;a great <a href="http://www.ilovemusicvideo.net/" rel="I love Music Video">mashup</a> of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> + <a href="http://www.last.fm/">LastFM</a>. <a href="http://www.ilovemusicvideo.net/">I Love Music Video</a> will grab all your info from last.fm and automatically connect it to the appropriate music videos at YouTube if they're available.</p> <p>I found it too cool! It's a very supercool app. They have provided only those things which are necessary, not more than that, that's the style I like!</p>
