For the last few months, I have been seeing a lot of different articles on the Internet about a technology called 'Ajax'. No, its not the stuff you use for cleaning your toilets. Ajax is a set of technologies that are being used together. The word Ajax is an acronym for 'Advanced Javascript And XML' or 'Asynchronous JavaScripting and XML'.<br /><br />Ajax is composed of the following web technologies:<br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">HTML + CSS</span>: displays the information in the browser.<br /></li>   <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">JavaScript</span>: dynamically displays content, and allows the user to interact with it.</li>   <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">XML + XSLT</span>: Using the browsers XMLHttpRequest function data can be requested, sent, or changed on the Web server.</li></ul><br />If you're not a Web application developer, most of these words and acronyms may not mean anything to you. Although, if you're like me, to understand a complex technology you need to see a good working example of it to really understand its full potential. Check out <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>. Search for a location, zoom-in on it, then click-and-drag on the map to see other parts of the map that are off the screen. The technology behind this marvel, is Ajax.<br /><br />Now the question, does Ajax really matter? If you're a web developer, the answer is yes it does. If you're just a web surfer, the answer is still yes.<br /><br />Ajax allows for the creation of interactive web applications that were not possible before without the use of some external plug-in technology like Flash, Java, etc. If you're just a web surfer, it means that you will be able to use feature rich applications without the use of external browser plug-ins.<br /><br />To learn more about Ajax, check out a site called '<a href="http://www.ajaxmatters.com/">Ajax Matters</a>'. This web site is one of the primary reference places for this technology.<br /><br />From <a href="http://ubergeek316.blogspot.com/2005/06/what-is-ajax-and-does-it-matter.html">In My Humble Opinion...
