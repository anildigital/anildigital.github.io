I found <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000870054492/">this</a> post. There is a large percentage of spam blogs-Splogs hosted by Google’s blogger.com. To fight this issue, Blogger introduced the new Flag button, which allow you report a certain blog if you think it contains spam or any inappropriate content to you.<br />Well, it’s a good thing for Blogger to acknowledge this very serious issue and start fighting it, and as a start they chose to depend on the collective power of the bloggers and blog readers to identify and flag spam blogs, and hopefully make a database out of them so that they can be excluded from blogs search engines.
