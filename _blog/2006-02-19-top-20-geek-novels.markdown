So far, 132 people have voted for <em><strong>the best geek novels written in English since 1932</strong></em>, in spite of Survey Monkey’s rubric saying free polls were limited to 100 responses. The top 20 is therefore as follows, with the numbers in brackets showing the number of votes. <p></p><p>1. The HitchHiker’s Guide to the Galaxy — Douglas Adams 85% (102)<br />2. Nineteen Eighty-Four — George Orwell 79% (92)<br />3. Brave New World — Aldous Huxley 69% (77)<br />4. Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? — Philip Dick 64% (67)<br />5. Neuromancer — William Gibson 59% (66)<br />6. Dune — Frank Herbert 53% (54)<br />7. I, Robot — Isaac Asimov 52% (54)<br />8. Foundation — Isaac Asimov 47% (47)<br />9. The Colour of Magic — Terry Pratchett 46% (46)<br />10. Microserfs — Douglas Coupland 43% (44)<br />11. Snow Crash — Neal Stephenson 37% (37)<br />12. Watchmen — Alan Moore & Dave Gibbons 38% (37)<br />13. Cryptonomicon — Neal Stephenson 36% (36)<br />14. Consider Phlebas — Iain M Banks 34% (35)<br />15. Stranger in a Strange Land — Robert Heinlein 33% (33)<br />16. The Man in the High Castle — Philip K Dick 34% (32)<br />17. American Gods — Neil Gaiman 31% (29)<br />18. The Diamond Age — Neal Stephenson 27% (27)<br />19. The Illuminatus! Trilogy — Robert Shea &amp; Robert Anton Wilson 23% (21)<br />20. Trouble with Lichen - John Wyndham 21% (19) </p>You can find most of them at project gutenberg site. I think I have to go through all of these to be a complete geek.
