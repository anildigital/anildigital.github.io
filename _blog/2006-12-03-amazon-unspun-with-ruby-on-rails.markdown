<p>I just checked and registered for Amazon's new service <a href="http://unspun.amazon.com/">UnSpun</a> (<a href="http://unspun.amazon.com/">unspun.amazon.com</a>). It's a rails application sitting on Amazon.com domain. Adam Selipsky from Amazon Web Services describes the UnSpun as<br /></p><blockquote> <p>UnSpun helps you to find and create ranked lists by gathering votes from workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk and from the UnSpun community. We show the popular opinion, with no “spin” (hence the name)—along with links to websites with more information about the particular items on the list. If you don’t see the list you are looking for, simply create it and rankings will start populating within a few minutes. 2,294 ranked lists are already on UnSpun, holding 640,107 items, with more coming in all the time.</p></blockquote> <p>I really liked this web application. Do see for <a href="http://unspun.amazon.com/list/show/1045?referrer=popular">Best Programming Language</a>. Ruby has got 9822 votes and Java 1044 votes. Ruby is the most popular under Best Programming Language. I hope Ruby to be there always. I am sure that <a href="http://unspun.amazon.com/">Amazon's UnSpun</a> will be more popular in coming days.<br />Top reasons are it's a new concept, it's having only those things which are necessary, good, intuitive GUI, it's social, it's built on Ruby on Rails, Powered by amazon.<br />It's really nice to see that high-profile companies have started using Ruby on Rails for various new projects.</p>
