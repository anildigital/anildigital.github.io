I am regretting about not to be part of <a href="http://railsrumble.com">Rails Rumble</a>. I was aware of it for long time. It was a great opportunity. Registrations have already been closed. I was busy in other personal activities. Though I knew that this is gonna happen on this weekend, I could not register on time. Now I am following this event being on #railsrumble IRC channel on freenode. Out of many people involved in rails rumble, you can follow <a href="http://akshaysurve.com">Akshay Surve</a> with his specially set up <a href="http://www.spraycannon.com/anonymous-serendipity/">devlog</a> for Rails Rumble.
