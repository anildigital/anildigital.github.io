<p>Today I created LiveJournal account. I was sick of blogging of personal things here on blogspot. I will continue to blog about technology and what I find useful here to be posted here. LiveJournal will be just my diary which will be maintained daily. Everything will be personal. Nothing to do with the things which are not related to me. Now there will be a simplicity for me and you people also. Here is <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/anildigital/">link</a> to my livejournal blog.<br /></p><p>I am a person who likes integrity. This means as my blogspot blog contains various links to what I do and what I use. The same will you see on my LiveJournal page. I know the importance of Web Presence. I don’t fear to write about my personal things on web. I find blogs as a very useful platform for this. I think having web presence always helps and benefits.</p><p><strong>Now playing:</strong> <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults?artistTerm=Amit%20Sana%20%28Indian%20Idol%29">Amit Sana (Indian Idol)</a> - <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults?songTerm=Chal%20Diye&amp;artistTerm=Amit%20Sana%20%28Indian%20Idol%29">Chal Diye</a></p>
