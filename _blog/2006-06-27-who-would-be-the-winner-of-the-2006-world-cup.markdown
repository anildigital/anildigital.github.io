<strong>Know something interesting about FIFA World Cup<br /></strong>Brazil won the world cup in 1994. Before that,they had won this title for the last time in 1970.<br />If you add up: 1970 + 1994 = 3964<br /><br />Argentina won the world cup for the last time in 1986. Before that only in 1978.<br />And 1978 + 1986 = 3964<br /><br />Germany, though, won the world cup in 1990. Before that, they won in 1974.<br />Look: 1990 + 1974 = 3964<br /><br />This could lead us to guess the winner of the World Cup in 2002, since it should be the winner<br />of the 1962 World Cup (In fact 3964 - 2002 = 1962).<br /><br />And Brazil won the world cup in 1962! (And, in fact, Brazil won the 2002 WC)<br />This numerology seems to work...<br /><br />And now, who would be the winner of the 2006 world cup?<br />Let's see, 3964 - 2006 = 1958<br /><br />And who won in 1958?....<br />Oh, Brazil did !!
