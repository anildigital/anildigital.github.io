Want to see your name in lights - or colors? Check out <a href="http://googlefor.com/mygoogle.aspx">GoogleFor</a> - it's a truly personalized search page to start on. It doesn't personalize your results, or even give you customization options. All it does is replace "Google" with the name or word of your choice. Yes, that's a different take on personalization, and yes my tongue has been firmly planted in cheek for the duration of this post. But this is kind of fun; check it out.<br />from <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/">downloadsquad</a>
