<div style="text-align: justify;">The year 2005 was a memorable year to me. Last three years I experienced a very fast life, but this year was a cool and relaxed one. I learnt various new things in this year. I saw various personalities including A. R. Rahman, Bharat Jadhav, Viveik Oberoy, Subhash Ghai, Urmila Martondkar, Sonu Nigam, Jitendra Joshi( a marathi actor), Navin Prabhakar(Pehchan Kaun?), Shatrughna Sinha, Viju Khote, Mandar Shinde, Abhijeet Sawant(Indian Idol), Rahul Vaidya, Sameera Reddy, Isha Sharwani. This was the year when I didn't find my college bore. I enjoyed college. One thing I miss is I didn't trip . Normally, from last 4 years, I had a trip with my friends. I read Chetan Bhagat's Five Point Someone. This year I became mobile, means I got mobile to use. I cannot forget this year I read a very large number of blogs on various topics. Most of the blogs were tech related. I recommend blogs as the most important source of information. I used many web 2.0 sites. I used my Yahoo messenger a lot. I used <a href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a> a lot. It is currently showing "You are currently using 379 MB (14%) of your 2679 MB." I used <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> a lot. del.icio.us is my favourite site. It is currently showing my "All your items (729)", it means I bookmarked 729 sites until now. I can't forget the instant success of <a href="http://goototal.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Google Total</a>. I tried to create various sites such as <a href="http://punetimesonline.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Pune Times Online</a>. Among the TV serials, I enjoyed Indian Idol, Laughter Challenge &amp; Laughter Champions. Overall, the year was an interesting year to me.</div>
