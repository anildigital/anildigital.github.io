When this feature is enabled in Gmail, your chats on Google Chat get stored in your Gmail account. So you can exchange your chats with others without having to log on to separate chat program, making instant messaging simpler and more integrated with the e-mail program. Also from anywhere in Gmail, the user can see who is available to chat. For more information, check the <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/chat.html">link</a>!
