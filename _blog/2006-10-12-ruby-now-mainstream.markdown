<p><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> programming language now can be called as mainstream programming language. If you are still not sure, checkout the site <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm">http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm</a> according to which Ruby now got the 13th position from top. I liked Ruby always and still prefer Java for enterprise level. Java has continued to maintain the top position and will remain there for years to come. I am sure that Ruby will gain the position in coming months and prove its strength as a mainstream language. I am fan of both these languages. Oreilly Ruby blog has also post written by <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2109">Curt Hibbs</a> a post titled <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2006/10/ruby_declared_mainstream.html">Ruby declared "mainstream"</a>,  check that out. </p>
