<p>Recently I read an article on <a href="http://lifehacker.com">Lifehacker</a> which is one of my favorite sites. Article titled <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/google-reader/geek-to-live-from-bloglines-to-google-reader-205786.php" target="_blank">From Bloglines to Google Reader</a>. I was really impressed from the article and I exported my <a href="http://bloglines.com" target="_blank">Bloglines</a> feeds to opml file and imported it into Bloglines and the magic started.&nbsp;The current <a href="http://google.com/reader" target="_blank">Google Reader</a> is so nice that I fell love with it. I liked the List view too much. </p> <p>I think my blog&nbsp;looks like one of dedicated Google blog. But that is not the case. I post the articles about the things that fascinates me. Google is the thing which continuously fascinating me from last 4 years. Hats off to <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>.</p>
