<p>A hack is a very common thing to do in programming. <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hack">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hack</a> has these definitions:<br />5. To accomplish a difficult programming task.<br />7. To make a quick code change to patch a computer program.<br /><br />Really correct definitions! I want to become a good ~hacker.<br /></p>
