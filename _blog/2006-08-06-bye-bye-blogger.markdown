<div style="text-align: justify;">Yup! I am leaving blogging at <a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a>! But not fully! I have created my new weblog at <a href="http://anilw.info/blog/">http://anilw.info/blog/</a>. My new blog is powered with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>. I have used <a href="http://typosphere.org">Typo</a> as a blogging software. Typo is a free, open source blogging software built on Ruby on Rails.<br /><br />I was blogging on Blogger since December 2004. Blogger have provided me various opportunities. I learned various things while blogging. I am the person who know the importance of blogging.<span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 153);"> Like everybody has its email id, mobile number, I feel everybody should have a blog/weblog. </span><br /><br />As I said I am not fully quitting Blogger, I will try to clone  my posts from <a href="http://anilw.info/blog/">http://anilw.info/blog/</a> to my Blogger blog. But I am not sure wheather I will use blogger in my future.  Actually, I have decided to use only <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">open source</a> softwares. I will not use any service or any software which is against open source. I am an open source fanatic. For certain conditions I have to use Windows at my home. But I am fully in the process of quitting Windows as my OS. I hope it will happen as soon as possible. These days I find, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> as a fantastic OS.  Ubuntu is based on <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>, which makes it really the best.<br /><br />Also, today I changed the look of my blogger blog, just because some of my friends told me that your blog is not rendered properly in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/">Internet Explorer</a>. I am so used to <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> that I dont open Internet Explorer for days.<br /><br />I promise you that you will see various nice things related to Ruby coding in my <a href="http://anilw.info/blog/">fresh blog</a>. Update your feeds and your links.</div>
