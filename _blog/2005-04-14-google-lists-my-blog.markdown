<p>Finally, my blog is listed by google. Today while googling, I made ego search & found that my blog is listed by google. I got excited. I was thinking why others blogs are listed & my blog not? But a great search engine like google searched my blog also my web page. Check it on google <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;q=anildigital&btnG=Search&amp;meta=">anildigital's blog</a>. Google is great! I am waiting for Yahoo! to list my blog. But surely Yahoo! will also list my blog. I regularly update my blog, this is why google listed my blog. If I update daily, google will cache it daily or once in a week. So updating the blog is important task for me. As I want to reach to the millions of people in the world and spread my thoughts to the world, I will try to update it regularly. </p>
