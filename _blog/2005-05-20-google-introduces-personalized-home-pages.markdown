<p>Google introduced a new service like My Yahoo!, which is <a href="http://www.google.com/ig" target="_blank">Google Fusion</a>. It allows you to arrange your Gmail, Google News, weather and a few select news services (including Slashdot) on a single page.  Future plans include Universal RSS support. It is one of the first Google labs launches without the "Beta" moniker; perhaps the reason is that it's not really that revolutionary. For long time, I was expecting such service from Google. How fast google is in introducing new services? Wow. Keep it up Google…..</p><p><em>Technorati Tags</em>: <a title="Technorati tag google" href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/google" target="_blank" rel="tag">Google</a>, <a title="Technorati tag fusion" href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/fusion" target="_blank" rel="tag">Fusion</a>, <a title="Technorati tag blog" href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/blog" target="_blank" rel="tag">Blog</a></p>
