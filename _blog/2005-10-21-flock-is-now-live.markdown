<div style="text-align: justify;">New social web browser <a href="http://flock.com/">Flock</a> is now available for download. But it is a developer preview. I was waiting for long time for flock to be available. I noticed that Flock is nothing but Firefox with some changes and improvements. It has been designed for social browsing experience. Flock has inbuilt blog posting facility, also its bookmarks can be integrated with del.icio.us. To download Flock developer preview here is the <a href="http://www.flock.com/developer/download/preview/">link</a>.</div>
