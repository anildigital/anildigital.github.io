<p>When I did </p> <p><span style="color:#400000;">I:\&gt;irb<br />irb(main):001:0&gt; require 'rubygems'<br />=&gt; false</span> </p><p>I got false for various require before when I did require 'something' in irb.<br />But while I was on IRC, dagbrown replied to my question<br /><br />&lt;dagbrown&gt; I'm shocked that nobody has noticed that if you say require "something" and it returns false, all that means is that it's already been required.<br /><br />I wasn't aware of precise reason..why require returns false.</p>
